    <h1>Study Techniques/Tips</h1>
    <h2>to help you ace your test ;)</h2>
    <p id="intro">
      There's a myth that you are either a visual, kinaesthetic or auditory
      learner, but it's important to differentiate between <em>preferring</em> a
      style of learning over <em>strictly choosing</em> one style of the other!
      We might prefer learning using one style, but it could also differ
      depending on the subject/thing you're trying to learn! Often, we can
      combine different styles of learning to aid our progress too(which is my
      preferred way of learning!)
    </p>
    <h3>Useful things you can do</h3>
    <p id="section1">
        <ul>
            <li>Review the syllabus</li>
            <li>Traffic light ratings for topics/concepts (helps you prioritise and organise your revision/study schedule)</li>
                <div>I.e: </div>
                <ul><li>red - don't understand</li>
                <li>yellow - understand bits but needs more work</li>
                <li>green - confident with understanding</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Understand how the exam might be formatted</li>
                <div>e.g. will you be required to draw graphs, work out equations, remember formulae from memory</div>
            <li>Think about useful ways of presenting information that might aid your understanding</li>
                <div>e.g. I will use flow charts to understand processes, mindmaps, graphing websites</div>
            <li> Keep a drink next to you and maybe some snacks! Your brain is working hard and needs fuel for energy!</li>
            <li> Breaks should also be apart of your study plan! You should be taking both short and long breaks to help you absorb info and rest from your hard work</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Learning Techniques</h3>
    <p id="section2">
        <div>Remember that learning is personal! So you could find all, some or none suit you. It's also important to tailor techniques to help your own understanding i.e. just because someone else studies in a certain way and gets good grades, doesn't mean that you have to do the same thing as them.</div>
        <ol>
            <li>Making your own notes</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Includes rephrasing things your teacher/textbook said</li>
                    <li>Make sure that it's something that you can come back to in a few weeks/months and still understand</li>
                    <li>Allows you to format the content in ways that you find helpful e.g. bulletpoints, diagrams, graphs</li>
                    <li>Use different resources to make notes from not just your teacher + class textbook!</li>
                    <div>E.g. there are websites, YouTube videos, other textbooks, your classmates</div>
                </ul>
            <li>Summarisation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Allows you to make content smaller and more easily digestible</li>
                    <li>Might not be the best for things that are content heavy (and detail-oriented)</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Explaining to yourself/another person</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Challenges yourself into understanding a concept fully (more about understanding than just remembering something by memory)</li>
                    <li>Ask yourself questions about the topic and see if you're able to answer them</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Practice tests</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gets you to become more familiar with exam formatting</li>
                    <li>Doesn't necessarily need to be in a test environment! I've done practice tests in the past with my notes in front of me to see how I can apply my knowledge to a question given.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Spaced repetition</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Involves testing/recalling information/looking over topics over a longer period of time e.g. weeks/months</li>
                    <li>Good memorisation technique</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Highlighting & rereading</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Probably the most popular study technique used by students!</li>
                    <li>Allows you to become more familiar with content & pick out key facts/details that might be important</li>
                    <li>Shouldn't be used just by itself (not as effective for memorisation or understanding)</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Prioritisation and its importance</h3>
    <p id="section3">
        <ol>
            <li>Remember that setting realistic goals is important!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instead of striving for perfection in all that you do, acknowledge that there will be things that you will struggle with and that's perfectly okay!</li>
                    <li>Make sure the amount you're setting yourself is also realistic. Ask yourself if you can realistically study and understand the 10+ topics that you want to get through today? We can often become disappointed in ourselves when we don't achieve our goals, so it's important to set daily goals that are <em>achievable</em> in order to maintain motivation</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Study efficiently!</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Instead of focusing all your energy into understanding one concept that you're finding really difficult, ask yourself if you'd benefit more from gaining more confidence in topics you're already okay at?</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
    </p>
